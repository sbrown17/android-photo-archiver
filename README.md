#Android Photo Archiver
This is probably going to be more generic than just an android photo archiver...
Essentially this will be a program that takes files from one directory path, saves the list of names to a new file, and then copies those files to a new directory.
Saving the list of names before moving them should allow for the program to pick back up where it left off should something occur during longer transfers (moving gigabytes of photos and video to a HDD can take hours)
